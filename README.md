# Voice-Assistant-using-Generative-AI
creating rest API and points or streaming services that integrate with a front end application.

We have a front end developer on the team, your role will be limited to creating a voice assistant that can coach people on a certain topic. you will be creating API endpoints integrating with the database, and most of the work will be to integrate generative AI capabilities to create a human like voice assistant experience.



- experience with ChatGPT API
- experience with creating voice assistants
- experience with prompt engineering
- experience, integrating, databases and injecting dynamic data into prompts

  -------------------
  To create a REST API that integrates a voice assistant using generative AI capabilities, you can use Flask as your web framework. Below, I'll outline the steps to create a basic API that allows you to interact with a voice assistant, leveraging the ChatGPT API and connecting to a database.
Setup

    Install Required Libraries First, install the required libraries:

    bash

    pip install Flask openai Flask-SQLAlchemy

    Create the Flask App

Hereâ€™s a basic structure for your Flask application:

python

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import openai

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configuration for your database
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///assistant.db'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

# OpenAI API key configuration
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

# Database model for user queries
class UserQuery(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    query = db.Column(db.String(255), nullable=False)
    response = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)

db.create_all()

@app.route('/ask', methods=['POST'])
def ask_assistant():
    user_input = request.json.get('input')

    # Generate a response using the ChatGPT API
    response_text = generate_response(user_input)

    # Store the query and response in the database
    store_query(user_input, response_text)

    return jsonify({'response': response_text})

def generate_response(user_input):
    # Call OpenAI's ChatGPT API
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": user_input}
        ]
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']

def store_query(query, response):
    # Store the user query and response in the database
    new_query = UserQuery(query=query, response=response)
    db.session.add(new_query)
    db.session.commit()

@app.route('/history', methods=['GET'])
def get_history():
    queries = UserQuery.query.all()
    history = [{'query': q.query, 'response': q.response} for q in queries]
    return jsonify(history)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation

    Flask Setup: We create a Flask application and configure it with SQLite for simplicity. You can replace this with any other database if needed.

    Database Model: We define a UserQuery model to store user queries and responses from the AI.

    API Endpoints:
        /ask: This endpoint accepts a POST request with a JSON body containing the user's input. It generates a response using the ChatGPT API, stores the query and response in the database, and returns the response.
        /history: This GET endpoint retrieves the history of queries and responses stored in the database.

    OpenAI API Integration: The generate_response function interacts with the ChatGPT API to get a human-like response.

    Database Storage: The store_query function saves the user query and its response in the database.

Frontend Integration

Your front-end developer can use this API to create an interactive voice assistant experience. They can send user input to the /ask endpoint and play the generated audio response using a text-to-speech library (e.g., Google Text-to-Speech or Amazon Polly).
Deployment

When deploying, ensure you:

    Secure your OpenAI API key and database credentials.
    Consider using a production-ready database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
    Implement error handling and validation for production use.

This basic setup provides a foundation for creating a voice assistant that can coach users on specific topics by leveraging generative AI capabilities.
